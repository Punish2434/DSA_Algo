Sure, let's break it down:

### Time Complexity:
Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm or operation increases with the size of the input. It's often expressed using Big O notation. Here's a brief overview of common time complexities:

1. **O(1) - Constant Time**: The runtime does not depend on the size of the input. Example: accessing an element in an array by index, inserting or deleting an element at the beginning of a linked list.
   
2. **O(log n) - Logarithmic Time**: The runtime grows logarithmically with the size of the input. Example: binary search in a sorted array, finding an element in a balanced binary search tree.
   
3. **O(n) - Linear Time**: The runtime grows linearly with the size of the input. Example: iterating through an array or a linked list.
   
4. **O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time**: The runtime grows in proportion to n multiplied by the logarithm of n. Example: sorting algorithms like merge sort, heap sort.
   
5. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Time**: The runtime grows quadratically with the size of the input. Example: nested loops iterating over an array or a matrix.
   
6. **O(2^n) - Exponential Time**: The runtime doubles with each addition to the input size. Example: naive recursive algorithms without memoization.

### Space Complexity:
Space complexity measures how the memory usage of an algorithm or operation increases with the size of the input. It's also often expressed using Big O notation. Here's a brief overview:

1. **O(1) - Constant Space**: The memory usage is constant, regardless of the input size. Example: storing a fixed number of variables.
   
2. **O(n) - Linear Space**: The memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input. Example: storing elements in an array or a linked list.
   
3. **O(n^2) - Quadratic Space**: The memory usage grows quadratically with the size of the input. Example: storing elements in a 2D array or matrix.
